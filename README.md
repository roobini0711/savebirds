# savebirds
The project is mainly based reducing the frequency of the cell towers and all the companies follow the required minimum bandwidth required for wifi/network. To save birds as high frequency affects those birds and affects their eggs. So this project focuses on minimising the frequency of the cell towers using the frequency sensors and after checking on them, we will send a message to the respective cell company head quarters for alerting them.
